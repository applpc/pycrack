# pycrack
Open-Source python based hash decryption tools.

Current Build for <a href=https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/>Python 2.7.13</a>

Download the current version of python<a href=https://www.python.org/downloads/>here</a>.

The tools that are currently included in this repository are solely for MD5 hashes, and I may add the code for other hashing types.

This code is intended to educate on how python can be used to crack hashes using several different means such as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_attack>brute-force</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack>dictionary</a> attacks.
